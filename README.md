# Goodreads Book Analysis and recommender

## Project Goal
This repository contains code to first explore and investigate patterns in 
the goodreads database (Goodreads.ipynb) and then use the database to provide 
recommendations (Book_recommender.ipynb).

Goodreads is a social media platform dedicated to the sharing and rating of books. The website contains a large database of books and associated details including titles, authors and publishers along with quotations and reviews from users. 

The data used here has been scraped using a dedicated web scraper (see the
Goodreads_scraper repo). 

## Exploratory Data Analysis <a id="eda"></a>

The goal of this project is to use this vast dataset to explore how different attributes relate and contribute to the popularity of a book. With a huge number of possible relationships to investigate, with focus on just a few here such as:

- What are the highest rated books and what makes them so?


- Who are the most prolific and most popular authors and how do their ratings 
vary over time?

- Do attributes of a book such as the number of pages or the month it was 
published correlate with how much 
        they are read or how highly they are rated?
