# Goodreads Book Analysis and recommender

Goodsreads is a social media platform dedicated to the sharing and rating of books. The website contains a large database of books and associated details including titles, authors and publishers along with quotations and reviews from users. 

The goal of this project is to use this vast dataset to explore how different attributes relate and contribute to the popularity of a book. With a huge number of possible relationships to investigate, with focus on just a few here such as:

- What are the highest rated books and what makes them so?


- Who are the most prolific and most popular authors and how do their ratings 
vary over time?

- Do attributes of a book such as the number of pages or the month it was 
published correlate with how much 
        they are read or how highly they are rated?
